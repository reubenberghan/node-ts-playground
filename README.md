# Node.js with TypeScript Playground

This is a playground repo for hacking in Node.js using Express.

## Things to do

- [x] testing
- [x] logging
- [x] routing / apis (under a `routes/api` directory)
- [ ] error handling
- [ ] db integration / mocking
- [ ] auth

### Next step

~~Error handling and logging~~
Broaden error handling to handle errors that aren't an instance of `Error`
