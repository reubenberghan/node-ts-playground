# Node.js with TypeScript Playground

This is a playground repo for hacking in Node.js using Express.

## Things to do

- [x] testing
- [x] logging
- [x] routing / apis (under a `routes/api` directory)
- [x] error handling
- [ ] db integration / mocking
- [ ] auth

### Next step

DB integration / mocking. At least mock a basic user schema and CRUD actions.
